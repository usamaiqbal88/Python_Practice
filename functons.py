#  lambda function

print("\nlambda function")

#A lambda function is a small anonymous function.
# A lambda function can take any number of arguments, but can only have one expression.
# Lambda functions reduce the number of lines of code when compared to normal python function defined using def keyword. 
# But this is not exactly true because, even functions defined with def can be defined in one single line. 
# But generally, def functions are written in more than 1 line.
# They are generally used when a function is needed temporarily for a short period of time,
#  often to be used inside another function such as filter, map and reduce.
# Using lambda function, you can define a function and call it immediately at the end of definition. 
# This canâ€™t be done with def functions.
